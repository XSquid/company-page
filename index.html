<!-- todo:
Complete the header section, space the links properly. Put them in a flexbox, space them into 1/3. Put a picture spacer between the header and the products page section. 
Do the same spacer picture for each section, doesnt have to be large. could be something like a barbell?
Finish the team section, can copy CSS from one of the other sections for layout.
Add footer section

Change background of each area, make it look not ugly. after that should be good for this project-->
